`numademo` links with a library derived from the C version of STREAM by John D.
McCalpin and Joe R. Zagar for one sub benchmark. See `stream_lib.c` for the
license. In particular when you publish `numademo` output you might need to pay
attention there or filter out the STREAM results.

It also uses a public domain Mersenne Twister implementation from Michael
Brundage.
